# MirageVD

MirageVD is a lightweight virtual display solution for macOS that allows you to create an additional screen sharing zone without needing physical hardware.

**Share only what matters in online meetings**

Create a region, and share it in Teams, Zoom and other meeting apps.  
Simpler than heavy streaming software, and more flexible than Window sharing.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### 2. Capture the selected region
MirageVD creates a window with the selected region.

<video width="100%" controls>
  <source src="assets/2-create.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### 3. Share the captured region
Choose MirageVD display and present safely.

Keep your desk clean with one monitor, and share only the slice they need to see.

Native Mac app, notarized by Apple, with payments handled via Paddle (the same checkout trusted by indie Mac apps like BetterTouchTool).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is MirageVD free?

Yes. MirageVD is free forever.

### Why not just use "Share Window" in Teams/Zoom?

Window sharing works if you only need one app. MirageVD is for cases where you need **multiple apps visible at once** (e.g. IDE + browser + terminal). You can show just what matters, nothing else.

### Why not just use OBS, DeskPad, or other tools?

Those apps are powerful and great for advanced use cases. But sometimes you don't need all the extra features — you just want to share a clean region of your screen quickly. MirageVD is built to do exactly that: lightweight, simple, and focused on everyday screen sharing.

### Is this Mac only?

Yes. macOS doesn't have a built-in region-to-share feature. MirageVD fills that gap.

### Is it safe to install?

Yes. MirageVD is a notarized Mac app, with payments handled securely via Paddle (trusted and widely used checkout provider).
